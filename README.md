# CAEN communication library
Small library to control CAEN devices over USB. For a library to control VME based modules with
python, one can use the [pyVME library](https://github.com/fneuhaus/pyvme).

It currently supports the following modules:
- CAEN N1471 / DT1471ET


Note: The controller for CAEN 1471 might also support other CAEN HV modules that are controlled via
USB. However due to lacking devices for testing, this is neither tested nor officially supported at
this time.
